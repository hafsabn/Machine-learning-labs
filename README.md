# Machine Learning Labs – AI & Data Science Track

This repository contains a series of machine learning labs completed as part of my AI and Data Science studies. Each lab focuses on key foundational topics in ML, implemented using Python and essential data science libraries.


## Lab Summaries

### Lab 1: Python for Data Science – Foundations
Our first contact with Python and Jupyter. We started working with basic Python syntax, explored Kaggle datasets, and used pandas for handling DataFrames.

### Lab 2: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
We learned how to clean and prepare data using various techniques. This included handling missing values, detecting outliers, and other preprocessing methods essential before modeling.

### Lab 3: Regression (Simple & Multiple)
We explored regression in two parts: simple linear regression and multiple regression. We implemented both and observed the impact of adding features on model performance.

### Lab 4: Classification & SVM Implementation
- Worked with logistic regression, KNN, and decision trees.
- Built a Support Vector Machine (SVM) from scratch to understand the algorithm’s mechanics.
- Evaluated models using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

### Lab 5: Clustering
- Introduced to unsupervised learning through clustering techniques.
- Implemented K-Means and hierarchical clustering.
- Used metrics like silhouette score and the elbow method to determine optimal clusters.
- Visualized cluster assignments and analyzed the structure of data.


## Technologies Used
- Python (Jupyter Notebooks)
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn ..etc
